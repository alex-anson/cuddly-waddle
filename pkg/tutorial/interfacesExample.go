	// So "w" is holding a Writer, which is something that implements the Writer
	// interface. We don't know the concrete type - we know how to invoke the Write
	// method because that's defined by the Writer interface, but within this
	// interfaceMain ∆ín, we don't know what is being written to - that's the

// If this were a struct, we'd enter the data we want the struct to hold on to -
// structs are ultimately data containers. Interfaces don't describe data, interfaces
// describe behavior. (... method definitions)
// DEFINE THE INTERFACE
// Anything that implements this interface will take in a slice of bytes and write
// it to something (i.e. the console, a TCP connection, the file system).
type Writer interface {
	// Will return an integer (normally, the number of bytes written) and an error
	Write([]byte) (int, error)

// ^ The naming convention for single method interfaces (which are common) is to
// use the method name plus "er". (i.e., a Read method's interface should be Reader)
// Naming multiple method interfaces is more challenging, but it should always be
// named by what it does.

// Gonna implement the Writer interface with a ConsoleWriter implementation, which
// is a struct
type ConsoleWriter struct{}

// In Go, we don't explicitly implement interfaces.

// Implicitly implement the interface by creating a method on the ConsoleWriter
// that has the signature of a Writer interface.

// a Writer instance.

// Don't HAVE to use a struct (though it's one of the most common ways to implement
// interfaces). Any type that can have a method associated with it (this is ALL
// types) can implement an interface.
// Defining a new interface, Incrementer:
type Incrementer interface {
	// Increment will be a method that returns an integer. It will increment
	// *something.* So, whatever we're gonna implement this thing with, is going
	// to increment values.
	Increment() int
}

// Defining a type alias for an integer.
type IntCounter int

// ^ Can't add a method directly to the int type - that is not under our control
// i.e., couldn't do "func (ic *int) Increment() int {" in the implementation --
// error = "cannot define new methods on non-local type int        compiler InvalidRecv"

// Adding a method to the IntCounter custom type. This is the implementation for
// the Incrementer interface.
func (ic *IntCounter) Increment() int {
	// Incrementing the type itself... "type IntCounter int" is a type alias for
	// an integer - which IS A NUMBER.
	// We have a type defined on an integer, and the integer itself is storing the
	// data that the method is using.
	*ic = *ic + 2
	return int(*ic)
}

// How to compose interfaces together - very powerful concept in Go, one of the
// keys to scalability.
// Single method interfaces are very common & powerful, BECAUSE they define a very
// specific behavior. Because they have one method, they're pretty unopinionated,
// and can be implemented in a lot of ways - which means they're really flexible.
