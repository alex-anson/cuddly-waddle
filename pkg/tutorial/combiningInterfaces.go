// in chunks (lack of better term) consisting of no more than eight characters.

// just an example of how you might use this WriterCloser interface in a way that
// runs in the Go playground easily

// Single method interfaces are very common & powerful, BECAUSE they define a very
// specific behavior. Because they have one method, they're pretty unopinionated,
// and can be implemented in a lot of ways - which means they're really flexible.
